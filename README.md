# Finite-Group-Theory
This is a project for finding all possible group structures by computer, given the group order n. The abstract group structures are presented as the multiplication tables in this code. We should test the famous four pieces of definitions of a group and avoid the possible repeated cases.<br>
In practice, this traditional algorithm can only test the group structures up to order n=4 on personal computer. And we try to test the n=5 case on high performance computing. After more than seven hours and nearly 25 billion trials, it is verifed that the group of order 5 has just one trivial case (Z_5 group), as the picture shows.<br>
The next step in the plan is try to find some lower dimensional representation of finite groups. But up to now we just find the algorithm that could figure out the regular representation of a given group, which seems like a little bit trivial. So if anyone have great idea about how to find all the irreducible representations of a group, be free to comment or pull request!
